Now control your Mitsubishi Heavy Industries air conditioner from anywhere with Homey.

Check the temperature in your room(s) while on the move. If necessary, turn on your air conditioner before you get home. You don't remember if you turned off the air conditioner? Then switch off your air conditioner via Homey.

For the correct operation of this Homey App, it is necessary that your air conditioner is equipped with a WF-RAC WiFi adapter which is already configured via the Smart-M-Air app.

This Homey App is NOT SUITABLE for models equipped with the newer INWFIMHI001I000 WiFi adapter which is configured via the AC-Cloud app.

IMPORTANT: Make sure the air conditioners have static IP addresses on your local network.
